#BuildYourOwnNewsletters.com

Current Situation: A basic website exists that provides little information and is not promoted at all. 
The home page is also the entry point for current users to access the software. The current website does not
adequately reflect the marketing message and needs to be completely redone.

Desired Result: a website that business owner believes reflects the unique selling propositions for the 
newsletter service to all targeted audiences, reinforces the credibility and integrity of the business and 
promotes the ease of use of the newsletter software and custom-contracted newsletters. Additionally, it should
provide several callouts to promote free trial and encourage contact.

Additional details:
1. Target audiences: high school and college athletic administrators, coaches and conference administrators and
executive directors or board members of professional organizations.
2. Intent of website is not to sell service immediately, but to gain a free trial or custom quote request.
3. Primary callout offer is for a free trial of the newsletter service.
4. Scope of project only includes the promotional website, not the newsletter service software.
5. Business owner recognizes that the website, as a tool in the early part of the sales process, will need to 
sell users on benefits of newsletter communication first, before selling them on his service. 
Copy of website should reflect these priorities.

##UX
The business owner gains most business through referrals. However, he intends to launch an email marketing
campaign to small privately-owned high schools in near future and wants a website to use as a sales tool 
for not only this campaign but others and to support sales efforts.

Target Audiences:
1. High school coaches and adminstrators looking for a tool to enable them to communicate regularly in an
easy and cost-efficient manner with relevant stakeholders, such as students and parents and possibly 
corporate sponsors.
2. College administrators and coaches, also looking for a tool to communicate periodically in an easy and
cost-efficent manner with stakeholders, including potential donors, with whom they want to cultivate relationships.
Stewardship communication is important to this audience and must be addressed in website copy.
3. Board members or executive directors of professional organizations who are looking for a tool to help
them communicate easily and cost-efficiently with members regarding their organization's activities.

User Stories:
1. As a site visitor from a high school visiting the site, I want to quickly view the benefits of using 
the newsletter service, see who else is using the service, as well as samples, and have a way to contact
the business.
2. As a site visitor from a college visting the site, I want to quickly view the benefits of using the 
newsletter, including how it will help me increase donations, see who else is using the service, as well 
as samples, and have a way to contact the business.
3. As a site visitor from a professional organization, I want to quickly view the benefits of using the 
newsletter service, see other professional organizations using the service, as well as samples, and see an 
easy way to contact the business.

In addition to communicating desired messages, described above, the new website needs to meet the following 
criteria:
1. Easy to navigate/use
2. Benefits of communication and USP need to pop out to reader without being buried in too much text
3. Copy reinforces credibility of BuildYourOwnNewsletters
4. Numerous callouts exist to try to grab users' attention at different points in message

Strategy Trade-off
The attached list and grid was developed to determine the key features for the website.
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="assets/images/MilestoneProject_appendix_1_24_20.pdf"></img>
</div>

Regarding the list of features - all were considered important and viable. However, due to resource 
contraints, the Video Tutorial was delayed and will be implemented at a later date. Additionally, 
the Frequently Asked Questions was delayed until users can be interviewed more fully to determine 
most relevant topics. All other features were implemented.


##Wireframe Mockups:

After meeting with the client regarding needs, the following mockups were designed, discussed with
the client, and revised based on our discussion. The mockups were developed using Balsamiq software 
(https://balsamiq.com/).

###Desktop
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src=""></img>
</div>

###Tablet
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src=""></img>
</div>

###Mobile
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src=""></img>
</div>

During creation, the following changes were made to improve the design originally created
with the WireFrames.

*1 - Callout Section: The image selected by the client is horizontal and did not look good
when applied to only half of the screen. The design was revised so that it became a hero image at
100% width with the headlines following below the image.
*2 - Services1: No change to original design
*3 - Services2: No change to original design
*4 - Services3: To best preserve resolution and length of newsletter samples, reduced number of 
samples to one for mobile and two across for tablets and larger.
*5 - Services4: Removed buttons from service descriptions due to proximity of Contact form.
*6 - Customers: Reduced number of quotes to one for mobile and removed styling so easier to view.
For tablet and larger sizes, reduced number of quotes to two, again to ease readability.
*7 - Contact: Combined the closing icon and headline with the Contact form to improve ease of 
reading. Also changed form format to stacked versus horizontal to improve ease of use in all formats.

responsive on each of the five primary screen sizes.
