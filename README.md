Current Situation: A basic website exists that provides little information and is not 
promoted at all. The home page is also the entry point for current users to access the 
software. The current website does notadequately reflect the marketing message and needs 
to be completely redone.

Desired Result: a website that business owner believes reflects the unique selling 
propositions for the newsletter service to all targeted audiences, reinforces the 
credibility and integrity of the business and promotes the ease of use of the newsletter 
software and custom-contracted newsletters. Additionally, it shouldprovide several 
callouts to promote free trial and encourage contact.

Additional details:
1. Target audiences: high school and college athletic administrators, coaches and 
conference administrators and executive directors or board members of professional 
organizations.
2. Intent of website is not to sell service immediately, but to gain a free trial or 
custom quote request.
3. Primary callout offer is for a free trial of the newsletter service.
4. Scope of project only includes the promotional website, not the newsletter service 
software.
5. Business owner recognizes that the website, as a tool in the early part of the sales 
process, will need to sell users on benefits of newsletter communication first, before 
selling them on his service. The editorial content of website should reflect these 
priorities.

## UX
The business owner gains most business through referrals. However, he intends to launch an 
email marketing campaign to small privately-owned high schools in near future and wants a 
website to use as a sales tool for not only this campaign but others and to support sales 
efforts.

Target Audiences:
1. High school coaches and adminstrators looking for a tool to enable them to communicate 
regularly in an easy and cost-efficient manner with relevant stakeholders, such as students 
and parents and possibly corporate sponsors.
2. College administrators and coaches, also looking for a tool to communicate periodically 
in an easy and cost-efficent manner with stakeholders, including potential donors, with 
whom they want to cultivate relationships. Stewardship communication is important to this 
audience and must be addressed in website copy.
3. Board members or executive directors of professional organizations who are looking for a 
tool to help them communicate easily and cost-efficiently with members regarding their 
organization's activities.

User Stories:
1. As a site visitor from a high school visiting the site, I want to quickly view the 
benefits of using the newsletter service, see who else is using the service, as well as 
samples, and have a way to contact the business.
2. As a site visitor from a college visting the site, I want to quickly view the benefits 
of using the newsletter, including how it will help me increase donations, see who else is 
using the service, as well as samples, and have a way to contact the business.
3. As a site visitor from a professional organization, I want to quickly view the benefits 
of using the newsletter service, see other professional organizations using the service, as 
well as samples, and see an easy way to contact the business.

In addition to communicating desired messages, described above, the new website needs to 
meet the following criteria:
1. Easy to navigate/use
2. Benefits of communication and USP need to pop out to reader without being buried in too 
much text
3. Copy reinforces credibility of BuildYourOwnNewsletters
4. Numerous callouts exist to try to grab users' attention at different points in message

Strategy Trade-off
The attached list and grid was developed to determine the key features for the website.
<div style="text-align:center;">
(/README-assets/MilestoneProject_appendix_1_24_20.pdf)
</div>

Regarding the list of features - all were considered important and viable. However, due to 
resource contraints, the Video Tutorial was delayed and will be implemented at a later date. 
Additionally, the Frequently Asked Questions was delayed until users can be interviewed more 
fully to determine most relevant topics. All other features were implemented.


## Wireframe Mockups:

After meeting with the client regarding needs, the following mockups were designed,
discussed with and approved by the client. The mockups were developed using Balsamiq 
software (https://balsamiq.com/).

### Desktop
<div style="text-align:center;">
(/README-assets/BYONdesktop_only1.pdf)
</div>

### Tablet
<div style="text-align:center;">
(/README-assets/BYONtablet_only1.pdf)
</div>

### Mobile
<div style="text-align:center;">
(/README-assets/BYONmobile_only1.pdf)
</div>

During creation of the website, the following changes were made to improve the design 
originally created with the WireFrames.

1. Callout Section: The image selected by the client is horizontal and did not look good
when applied to only half of the screen. The design was revised so that it became a hero 
image at 100% width with the headlines initally following below the image and then applied
over the image.
2. Services1: No change to original design
3. Services2: No change to original design
4. Services3: To best preserve resolution and length of newsletter samples, reduced number 
of samples to one for mobile and two across for tablets and larger screen sizes.
5. Services4: Removed buttons from service descriptions due to proximity of Contact form.
6. Customers: Reduced number of quotes to one for mobile and removed styling so easier to 
view. For tablet and larger sizes, reduced number of quotes to two, again to ease 
readability.
7. Contact: Combined the closing icon and headline with the Contact form to improve ease of 
reading. Also changed form format to stacked versus horizontal to improve ease of use in 
all formats.

## Testing

Throughout development of the site, Chrome's Developer Tools were used to identify errors 
and ensure the site was responsive on each of the five primary screen sizes.

Additionally, towards the end of the project, I used the following tools to identify and 
resolve issues in the HTML and CSS codes.

* [FREEFORMATTER.COM HTML Validator/Linter] (https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.
html) Used to validate HTML.

* [The W3C CSS Validation Service] (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) Used to 
validate CSS.

* [Lighthouse Chrome] 
(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk/
related?hl=en) Used to audit loading times. Test results indicated slower than desired 
loading times so used tinypng to reduce images sizes and improve loading speed.

* [UnicornRevealer] 
(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unicorn-revealer/lmlkphhd
lngaicolpmaakfmhplagoaln?hl=en-GB) - used to assist in problem solving 
regarding margins, padding and alignment throughout design process

* [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - used many times to find answers to coding
dilemmas

* [autoprefixer]
(https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - used to find prefixes so styling worked on all
browsers; unfortunately it voided much of styling so I chose not to use recommended
changes.


### Issues and Resolutions

Below are the final issues that required resolution before completing the project.

1. Sticky Navbar covering headlines when clicking navbar links: I tried adjusting top
margins but after discussing with mentor, saw that the navbar height of 96px could be
compensated for with a top padding of 100px on all sections. Confirmed resolution by 
viewing deployed web page and testing links.

2. I had a width scroll bar appearing in deployed web page. I found it was the result of
a an extended row in the Customer page caused by having row columns that added up 
to >12. I fixed the column and offset widths so they equaled 12 and scroll bar disappeared.

3. At mentor's suggestion, I reviewed classes and any that were not used more than once
were changed to id's.

4. Based on Lighthouse report, I compressed images and replaced origianal images with
compressed images.

5. I ran Autoprefixer on the CSS code and found 5 changes. I implemented the changes and
lost much of the styling in those sections: navbar and the cards in services1 and services4.
Therefore, I removed the autoprefixer code and am acknowledging that those sections have 
issues with other browsers that I cannot resolve.

6. To move the Callout/Jumbotron text higher in browser window I tried a transparent 
background. To do this, I moved the hero image out of a row and made it the background image. 
Then I kept the Callout text in a row and made the Jumbotron background transparent 
(as Bootstrap default is white). Comments from the client and the Lighthouse report 
indicated that the text was not readable enough with the transparent background. To fix this
I deleted the jumbotron and placed the header copy in a card in a row/column. I then made
the container flex and positioned the card row at base of container and used a slightly
transparent gray background.

7. The form on the Contact page was not centering in screen sizes larger than mobile. 
After experimenting with margins and padding I researched the issue. On stackoverflow 
I found an idea to put the form in a container with a Bootstrap class of d-flex and then 
used center spacing utility classes for the container to align the form elements on the page. 


8. The newsletter sample issues were distorted in smaller screen sizes. I remembered that
the newsletters are mobile responsive, so I took screen shots of the mobile versions (and
compressed them). I then searched slackoverflow on how to swap the images. I found a
suggestion but my implementation was incorrect. Mark OBeirne on Slack helped me sort it out.
It did not work to place all the code in CSS as it was not accepting the images as
background-images within columns. So I put the images in the html and first tried the d-none
and d-md-block class codes to control which one displayed. This did not work, so I tried
the same code in CSS. It is working for the first newsletter sample, and for both in
large screens, but doesn't work for the second sample in medium and smaller screens. Solution
is to sway out the first sample that is working and only use the mobile version for the 
second sample.

9. The final issue was a problem with sizing of the logo in the navbar that appeared
sporadically. At end of project, it was occuring in all sizes. The CSS styling code was not
being recognized. I went back and checked all code in navagation section and removed some 
excess classes that were in error. I tried various combinations of specifying the image in 
CSS, finally determining that giving the image an id and specifying that worked better than
using navbar-brand class. That change succeeded in styling the larger screen sizes but 
not the smaller. The navbar styling was moved to top of CSS styling sheet and found it worked.
Mentor helped me find missing bracket in CSS code that was causing code to not be recognized.


### Known Issues

1. Some of the styling does not appear in all browsers - see #5 above.

2. The cover image does not appear when the website is loaded on an iPhone. It works
when viewing it in Developer Tools as iPhone, but not on actual phone.

3. The two-column Small College newsletter sample could not be successfully used (see #8
above).

4. Following HTML validation, I had 3 issues raised that I acknowledge but am not changing:
* "|" in FontAwesome link code is viewed as an illegal character
*  In Services1, card-header was seen as blank, but an icon is actually situated within header,
but no text
* the copyright symbol in the footer was seen as a "malformed byte sequence"
